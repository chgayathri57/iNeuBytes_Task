                <h2>Missile Man of India </h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam </b> was an accomplished Indian scientist and politician who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. Born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, Kalam studied physics and aerospace engineering before spending the next forty years as a scientist and science administrator. He was associated with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), and was deeply involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He earned the moniker <b>"Missile Man of India"</b> for his significant contributions to the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. Kalam also played a critical role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, which were the first since India's original nuclear test in 1974.

                <p>
                    Kalam was elected as the <b>11th president of India in 2002 </b>with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the <b> "People's President"</b>, he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including <i><b> the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.</i></b>

                    While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.

                            In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially Mathematics. After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954.
                            <br><br> He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology. While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline." He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.

                            After completing his degree in Aerospace Engineering, APJ Abdul Kalam started working for the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in 1958. At the DRDO, he contributed to the development of India's first satellite launch vehicle, the Rohini. He also played a crucial role in the development of missiles, including the Agni and Prithvi missiles. For his work on missile technology, he became known as the "Missile Man of India." <br><br>
                            In 1982, APJ Abdul Kalam joined the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) as the Director. At ISRO, he contributed to the development of satellite technology, including the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV). He was also involved in the successful launch of India's first satellite, Aryabhata, in 1975. Kalam's scientific achievements were recognized with numerous awards and honours, including the Padma Bhushan, the Padma Vibhushan, and the Bharat Ratna.

                            In July 2002, Kalam was nominated by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to be the presidential candidate. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the then-opposition Indian National Congress (INC) both supported his candidacy, and he was elected as the 11th President of India on 25 July 2002.
                            During his presidency, Kalam made it a point to interact with young people, particularly students, and encouraged them to pursue careers in science and technology. He also emphasized the importance of education, especially in rural areas. He was known for his informal approach to the presidency, frequently interacting with the public and going on morning walks outside the Rashtrapati Bhavan (the presidential palace).
                           <br><br> After serving a single term as President, Kalam returned to his civilian life of education, writing, and public service. He continued to be an active advocate for science and education until his death in 2015. Kalam's presidency is widely regarded as one of the most successful in India's history, with his popularity remaining high even after his term ended. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.
